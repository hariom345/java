//We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of
//100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. Create an
//abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two
//other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same name which returns the
//percentage of the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three
//subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student
//B. Create an object for each of the two classes and print the percentage of marks for
//both the students.
